## Not related to the course

### Learned how to use .nvmrc

1 - Add a .nvmrc file in the root of the project with the node version you want to use
2 - Add script in .zshrc/.bashrc to detect the .nvmrc file and auto switch node version using nvm

### Had trouble testing out latest ecma features despite being implemented in node 21

- Issue is related to tsconfig and/or package.json (module, type, target, etc)
- Need to investigate further
